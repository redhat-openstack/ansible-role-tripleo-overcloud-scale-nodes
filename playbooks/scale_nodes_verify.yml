# NOTE(hrybacki: inventory regeneration and overcloud validation must be completed in a second playbook. The
# deleted node is removed from the hosts file. However, it still exists in memory and will cause the
# 'ansible-role-tripleo-inventory: regenerate ssh config' task to fail when attempting to acces non-existant host vars

# Re-inventory the overcloud
- name:  Inventory the overcloud
  hosts: undercloud
  gather_facts: no
  roles:
    - tripleo-inventory

# Validate the overcloud
- name: Validate the overcloud post-delete-node
  hosts: undercloud
  gather_facts: no
  roles:
    - tripleo-overcloud-validate
